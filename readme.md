# Shopping App - Herolo Task

This is my project for herolo,
while building this app it was important for me that anyone could look at my code and
easily understand the structure, and architecture.
I divided my code into seperate components and pages, so it will be really easy to "jump in".
I've split the reduceres to make it easy to someone that has never seen the project - how the states are managed in the project and what files contain different parts of the project.

My goal for this project was to make a simple, clean, nice looking and understandable UI that shows necessary information and a bit more.
In addition I wanted to use Redux in a right way since I havn't used it before and I pleased with the outcome.

- The project is client only and does'nt use localhost because I dont think it was the goal of the task, but it can be easily added.
